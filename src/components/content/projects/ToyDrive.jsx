        I developed a vibrant and interactive website for organizing and
        participating in toy drives. The website is built with React, styled
        using Tailwind CSS, and animated with Framer Motion, ensuring a
        user-friendly experience. The repository is public in hopes that other
        fundraisers may be able to utilize it as a template or inspiration.
