                I developed a vibrant and interactive website for organizing and participating in toy drives. The website is built with React, styled using Tailwind CSS, and animated with Framer Motion, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The repository is public in hopes that other fundraisers may be able to utilize it as a template or inspiration.
